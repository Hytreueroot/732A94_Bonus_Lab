## Description
A package to handle linear regression models with using linear algebra. Implement a RC class to handle special functions.
Also package take a formula object as well as a dataset and return a ridgereg object. Implement a RC class to handle special functions.

### print()
This function print out the coefficients and coefficient names, similar as done by the lm class.

```ruby
mod_object$print()
```

### plot()
This function print out two graph ("Residuals vs Fitted" and "Scale-Location") using ggplot2.
```ruby
mod_object$plot()
```

### resid()
This function print out the vector of residuals $\hat{e}$.

```ruby
mod_object$resid()
```

### pred()
This function print out the predicted values $\hat{y}$.

```ruby
mod_object$pred()
```

### coef()
This function print out the coefficients as a named vector.

```ruby
mod_object$coef()
```

### summary()
This function print out a similar print out as printed for lm objects. It presents the coefficients with their standard error, t-value and p-value as well as the estimate of $\hat{Ïƒ}$ and the degrees of freedom in the model.

```ruby
mod_object$summary()
```
